	If you have already installed &PyGopherd; system-wide, or your
	administrator has done that for you, your task for setting up
	&PyGopherd; for the first time is quite simple.  You just need
	to set up your configuration file, make your folder directory,
	and run it!
      </para>
      
      <para>
	You can quickly set up your configuration file.  The
	distribution includes two files of interest:
	<filename>conf/pygopherd.conf</filename> and
	<filename>conf/mime.types</filename>.  Debian users will find
	the configuration file pre-installed in
	<filename>/etc/pygopherd/pygopherd.conf</filename> and the
	<filename>mime.types</filename> file provided by the system
	already.
      </para>

      <para>
	Open up <filename>pygopherd.conf</filename> in your editor and
	adjust to suit.  The file is heavily commented and you can
	refer to it for detailed information.  Some settings to take a
	look at include: <property>detach</property>,
	<property>pidfile</property>, <property>port</property>, 
	<property>usechroot</property>, <property>setuid</property>,
	<property>setgid</property>, and <property>root</property>.
	These may or may not work at their defaults for you.  The
	remaining ones should be fine for a basic setup.
      </para>

      <para>
	Invoke &PyGopherd; with <command>pygopherd
	  path/to/configfile</command> (or
	<command>/etc/init.d/pygopherd start</command> on Debian).
	Place some files in the location specified by the
	<property>root</property> directive in the config file and
	you're ready to run!
