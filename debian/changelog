pygopherd (1.99.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduced new "inode-like" caching system for ZIP files.
    Now, the first time a ZIP file is accessed, it will be scanned.
    Links will be resolved immediately.  A dictionary tree is built up;
    values being either file offsets in the ZIP file or dictionaries
    (for subdirectories).  This dictionary is then cached on-disk using
    a binary database and marshal algorithm derived from Python's shelve
    module.  We do not need to use pickle for this task since we are saving
    only simple structures.  The performance gain for large ZIP files using
    this method is tremendous.  The only time a ZIP file's central
    directory structure must be scanned now is the very first time it is
    ever accessed.
